# Resume Screening App using Machine Learning/NLP

## Overview
This project automates the resume screening process using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in candidate selection. It includes resume parsing, categorization, and job recommendations based on predefined criteria.

## Key Features

### 1. Resume Parsing
Our system utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract essential information from resumes, such as contact details, skills, education, and work experience. This automated parsing eliminates manual data entry, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

### 2. Categorization
Machine learning algorithms categorize resumes into predefined categories set by recruiters or hiring managers. This categorization enables quick identification of top candidates for further evaluation.

### 3. Job Recommendations
Leveraging ML models, our system recommends relevant job openings to candidates based on their skills, experience, and preferences. This personalized approach enhances candidate engagement and improves the match between candidates and job roles.

## Benefits

- **Time-saving**: Automating resume screening reduces the time and effort required for candidate selection, allowing recruiters to focus on strategic tasks.
- **Efficiency improvement**: ML algorithms ensure consistent and unbiased resume evaluation, leading to more informed hiring decisions.
- **Enhanced candidate experience**: Personalized job recommendations increase candidate satisfaction and engagement, contributing to higher retention rates and improved employer branding.

## Solution
